# RFSoC ZCU111 QPSK Transceiver Demo

## Introduction
This repo contains all the files needed to build and run the RFSoC ZCU111 QPSK demonstrator that was presented at both FPL and XDF conferences in 2018. The design is a full QPSK transceiver, which transmits and receives randomly-generated pulse-shaped symbols with full carrier and timing synchronisation. [Pynq](https://github.com/xilinx/pynq) is used to visualise the data at both the DAC and ADC side of the RFSoC data converters, as well as visualising various DSP stages throughout transmit and receive signal path.

## Requirements
### Hardware
- Xilinx ZCU111 development board Rev-1.0
- Minimum 8GB Micro SD Card
- SMA connector
### Software
- Vivado Design Suite 2018.2
- System Generator for DSP
- MATLAB 2017b
- ZCU111 Pynq v2.4 Image

(All software builds have been Tested on Ubuntu 16.04)

## ToDo
- Write short tutorial on how to set up hardware and run the demo
- Remove second high performance port from PS IP and use a top-level AXI Interconnect IP to serve Rx and Tx hierarchies
- Clean up IPI design
- Profile Plotly client-side performance
- Upgrade to Vivado 2018.3

## Known Issues
### Vivado
- Various warnings during synthesis and implementation need to be addressed (this is mainly development guff and can mostly be ignored).
### System Generator
- Large rate changes makes simulating current project incredibly slow.
### Pynq
- Live plots are currently quite demanding of the client browser (but not the RFSoC). A hefty desktop helps a lot in the meantime!
